		<script>
			function person(first, last, age, eye){
				this.firstName = first;
				this.lastName = last;
				this.age = age;
				this.eyeColor = eye;
			}
			var myFather = new person("Shabbir", "Mohammed", 40, "black");
			var myMother = new person("Masthurunissa", "Shaik", 30, "black");
			document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My father name is " + myFather.firstName + " " + myFather.lastName + ". My mother name is " + myMother.firstName + " " + myMother.lastName;
